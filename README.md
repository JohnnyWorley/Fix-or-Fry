# Fix-or-Fry

Fix or Fry is the game that my team and I created for our college's Game Jam. The theme this year was Sci-Fi. We had 3 days to make it at college with each day being around 7 hours, meaning we had a total of 21 hours to make (give or take).

In Fix or Fry, you are on a large spaceship that has just entered an asteroid field and sustained severe damage, because of this the gravity stabilisers have failed and now the entire ship is floating around in zero gravity! All the escape ships have been used apart from one with multiple missing parts. You must navigate the hangar in zero gravity while finding parts to fix the ship and escape, all before the self-destruct sequence goes off! While attempting to fix the ship there are also asteroids flying towards and into the hangar, if you are hit by these asteroids twice you will die and have to restart. You have a gravity gun to protect you which you can use to shoot the asteroids away from you, or you can just dodge them instead.

Overall in the Game Jam, this won us 3rd Place out of 8 Teams, although it should be noted we had 3 Team Members while all the other teams had 4. I was the programmer in the group and my teammates, Jack and Yaseen, were both 3D Modellers and Audio. I also get a separate award called 'Peer Support Award' for helping out other teams with their games.

I am also unable to upload the project files for some reason as everytime I attempt to drag them into either OneDrive or Google Drive they never finish uploading and exporting a Unity Package the package always corrupts.
